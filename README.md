Practical exercises on machine learning for biomass and yield forecasting

Two files are included:
- A file (.txt) including (i) 680 biomass data for 40 different sites in France and for 17 years (1995 to 2011), mean temperatures during the first part of the growing season (day 1 to day 50), during the second part of the growing season (day 51 to day 100) and during the last part of the growing season (day 101 to day 150),noted T1, T2, T3, and average radiations during the same periods (RAD1, RAD2, RAD3).
- A file including R codes predicting the final biomass of maize, noted B (g m-2), from the 6 input variables describing the climatic conditions during the growing season, under optimal water conditions. 

The R code fits several standard regression and machine learning tools and compares their accuracy.
